## :trident: Prework - Get LoD Ready

For this Hands-on Workshop, we are going to use Lab on Demand. Please enroll yourself the following Lab:
https://labondemand.netapp.com/node/878

First a big thank you to [Yves Weisser](github.com/yvosonthehub) as his LabNetApp repository is the foundation of this training material. I highly recommend to have look at his work and redo this from time to time as he is doing a tremendous job, explaining all the Trident functionalities with real good examples. 

**The Lab guide is only needed for getting the usernames and passwords. Please ignore the tasks in the lab guide, everything you need is in this github repository.**

Access the host *rhel3* via putty and clone this github repo

```console
git clone https://github.com/ntap-johanneswagner/tridenttraining2025
```

After that, jump into the directory, modify the access of the prework script and run it. This script will prepare the lab for our excercises.

```console
cd tridenttraining2025
chmod 777 prework.sh
./prework.sh
```

This will take some minutes...

## :trident: Scenario 01 - Install Trident
____
There are multiple ways to install Trident, the most common is working with the operator, deployed by Helm. Helm helps you manage Kubernetes applications by utilizing so called Helm Charts that help you to define, install and upgrade Kubernetes based applications.
Helm is already running in this lab so the first thing we need to do is to add the repository, where the Trident Helm Chart is.

```console
helm repo add netapp-trident https://netapp.github.io/trident-helm-chart
```

After this, we can tell Helm to install the operator.  
It's not unusual that customers don't allow to access public repositorys and have their own image registry. While we can access public registries in LoD, we have to fight with the Docker image pull rate limitation. Due to this, we are also working with a private registry, the necessary images are already cached there and the secret to access it is also created. 
The default command to install trident without any customization like private registry is looking like this:
```console
helm install <name> netapp-trident/trident-operator --version 100.2506.2 --create-namespace --namespace <trident-namespace>
```

`<name>` will be the name of our release, usually we just call it "trident"  

`--version`defines the version of Trident. Unfortunately Helm requires semantic versioning, while Trident uses calendaric versioning. As a workaround we modified the version of the helmchart to be 100.`<YYMM>`.`<Patch>`. The June Release of 2025 with Patch 2 is 25.06.2, the Helm Chart Version is 100.2506.2  

`<trident-namespace>`is the place where the operator and Trident will be deployed. Usually we also use "trident" here.

As we want to use a private registry, we modify the command a little bit:

```console
helm install <name> netapp-trident/trident-operator --version 100.2506.2 --create-namespace --namespace <trident-namespace> --set tridentAutosupportImage=registry.demo.netapp.com/trident-autosupport:25.06.0,operatorImage=registry.demo.netapp.com/trident-operator:25.06.2,tridentImage=registry.demo.netapp.com/trident:25.06.2,tridentSilenceAutosupport=true,windows=true,imagePullSecrets[0]=regcred
```

As soon you fired the command above (ensure that you place the right release name and namespace name!), the operator will start with the deployment. You can check this by discovering the pods in the namespace:

```console
kubectl get pods -n <trident-namespace>
```

If everything is successfull you should see one controller pod and one node pod per kubernetes node.

As our cluster has 3 nodes, the output should look like this:
```console
k get pods -n trident
NAME                                  READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
trident-controller-7cd95c9bf5-s5jpw   6/6     Running   0          107s
trident-node-linux-5v2cq              2/2     Running   0          107s
trident-node-linux-pc692              2/2     Running   0          107s
trident-node-linux-qnfg5              2/2     Running   0          107s
trident-operator-674cdcdbd5-bg2fx     1/1     Running   0          2m48s
```

## :trident: Scenario 02 - Configure Trident
**Remember: All required files are in the folder */home/user/tridenttraining2025/scenario02* please ensure that you are in this folder now. You can do this with the command** 
```console
cd /home/user/tridenttraining2025/scenario02
```
Installation is quiet easy and straight forward, the fun begins with the configuration. 

### Backends

Via a TridentBackend, we are telling Trident how to contact the storagesystem and which driver to use. There are two ways to create Backends. 1. via tridentctl, 2. via a TridentBackenConfiguration CRD in K8s. The second way is the most common today, so we use it for our excercise. If you want to find out how to do it with tridentctl, have a look at the documentation: https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/trident/trident-use/backend_ops_tridentctl.html#create-a-backend

You will see different example configurations in the folder, to cover the different drivers. 

backend-ontap-nas.yaml is an example for using the ontap-nas driver.  
backend-ontap-nas-eco.yaml is an example for using the ontap-nas-economy driver.  
backend-ontap-san.yaml is an example for using the ontap-san driver using iSCSI.  
backend-ontap-san-eco.yaml is an example for using the ontap-san-economy driver using iSCSI.  

Edit each of them using your favorite editor and insert the missing values. Please use the SVM "labsvm" for this tasks as the nassvm and sansvm is a leftover from the original lab.
Small hint: To find out the network of your k8s nodes, *kubectl get nodes -o wide* might be helpful. 

You might have noticed that there is a reference to the credentials, called secret-svm. To provide Trident the necessary credentials to login into the svm, there are different possibilities. Trident supports local users, certificates and LDAP users. In most of the cases local users are used, so we do here.

Edit the secret-svm.yaml file and fill in user and password (Hint for getting the password of the trident user if you don't want to reset it: Look into the ansible playbook at labsvm.yaml). You will also see that there are values for the chap configuration provided. As we specified *useChap: true* in the backends, we need to tell Trident these values as Trident will do this configuration at the SVM. 

After you edited all the files, apply them to your k8s cluster:

```console
kubectl apply -f backend-ontap-nas.yaml
kubectl apply -f backend-ontap-nas-eco.yaml
kubectl apply -f backend-ontap-san.yaml
kubectl apply -f backend-ontap-san-eco.yaml 
```

As soon as they are applied, you can check the status of them via *kubectl get tbc -n trident*

The output should look like this:

```console
kubectl get tbc -n trident
TO DOOOOOO
```

If everything is bound, all good. If the status is different to bound, inspect it via *kubectl describe tbc `<tbcname>`-n trident* find the errors and fix them. 

### StorageClass

The second thing we need to get Trident working, is a StorageClass that refers the PVC towards Trident.

In the folder you will find also some prepared files.

sc-nas.yaml is the StorageClass definition for the ontap-nas driver.  
sc-nas-eco.yaml is the StorageClass definition for the ontap-nas-economy driver.  
sc-san.yaml is the StorageClass definition for the ontap-san driver.  
sc-san-eco.yaml is the StorageClass definition for the ontap-nas-economy driver.

Have a quick look at them, this time there is no need for edits, and apply them:

```console
kubectl apply -f sc-nas.yaml
kubectl apply -f sc-nas-eco.yaml
kubectl apply -f sc-san.yaml
kubectl apply -f Sc-san-eco.yaml 
```

Check the status with *kubectl get sc*

```console
kubectl get sc
TO DOOOOOO
```

### VolumeSnapshotClass

While having backend and storageclass configured is enough to provide persistent storage, sooner or later there might be the need for doing so called CSI-Snapshots. For this a few other things are needed. 
First the snapshot controller needs to be installed/ enabled on the cluster. This should be the case in most of the modern distributions, however it happens still that its missing. If you want to have more details on how to install it, this link is a good read: https://github.com/kubernetes-csi/external-snapshotter
In our cluster, it's already installed, let's check this:  

```console
kubectl get crd | grep volumesnapshot
volumesnapshotclasses.snapshot.storage.k8s.io         2024-04-27T21:06:08Z
volumesnapshotcontents.snapshot.storage.k8s.io        2024-04-27T21:06:08Z
volumesnapshots.snapshot.storage.k8s.io               2024-04-27T21:06:08Z

kubectl get all -n kube-system -l app=snapshot-controller
NAME                                       READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
pod/snapshot-controller-54f7648f78-lvgp2   1/1     Running   6          93d
pod/snapshot-controller-54f7648f78-p9gvk   1/1     Running   6          93d

NAME                                             DESIRED   CURRENT   READY   AGE
replicaset.apps/snapshot-controller-54f7648f78   2         2         2       93d
```

Aside from the 3 CRD & the Controller StatefulSet, the following objects have also been created during the installation of the CSI Snapshot feature:  
- serviceaccount/snapshot-controller
- clusterrole.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/snapshot-controller-runner
- clusterrolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/snapshot-controller-role
- role.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/snapshot-controller-leaderelection
- rolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/snapshot-controller-leaderelection

This base is needed for every CSI-driver that needs CSI-snapshots the next what is needed is a so called VolumeSnapshotClass that tells k8s to address the csi driver for the snapshot. The necessary file is already in your folder, have a look at it and apply it afterwards.

```console
kubectl apply -f volumesnapshotclass.yaml
```

## :trident: Scenario 03 - Testing Trident with the first applications
**Remember: All required files are in the folder */home/user/tridenttraining2025/scenario03* please ensure that you are in this folder now. You can do this with the command** 
```console
cd /home/user/tridenttraining2025/scenario03
```

It's quiet important to understand that even if Trident creates Volumes successful and you can see the PVC/PV objects created in K8s, there is still a ton of things that can go wrong. To verfiy that installation and configuration is successful, it's important to run some kind of test application to verify that also the worker nodes were correctly prepared. 

There are 5 files in the folder. One will create a pod that has 4 PVCs, one for each storage class. The others have only one covering one sc. 

Apply them and have a look whether all works or if something fails. 

If there are errors, the first you should do is to have a look by using kubectl describe. Possible objects to start: Pod, PVC, trident controller.

## :trident: Scenario 04 - Backup anyone? Installation of Trident protect
**Remember: All required files are in the folder */home/user/tridenttraining2025/scenario04* please ensure that you are in this folder now. You can do this with the command** 

As K8s based applications become more and more important, people ask the mean questions around backup, dr and so on.

Since October 2024, Trident has a small add-on, called Trident protect. This little application is meant to do k8s native backup & DR.

We do this again utilizing a private registry. To access it we need a secret again, lets creat this first:

```console
kubectl create ns trident-protect
kubectl create secret docker-registry regcred --docker-username=registryuser --docker-password=Netapp1! -n trident-protect --docker-server=registry.demo.netapp.com
```

We are going to use parameters gathered in the trident_protect_helm_values.yaml file.
Now we can add the helm repository and install trident protect:

```console
helm repo add netapp-trident-protect https://netapp.github.io/trident-protect-helm-chart/
helm registry login registry.demo.netapp.com -u registryuser -p Netapp1!

helm install trident-protect netapp-trident-protect/trident-protect --set clusterName=lod1 --version 100.2506.0 --namespace trident-protect -f trident_protect_helm_values.yaml
```

After a very short time you should be able to see Trident protect being installed successfully. 
```console
kubectl get pods -n trident-protect
NAME                                                           READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
trident-protect-controller-manager-6454f4776f-6ls7v            2/2     Running   0          1h
```

Trident Protect CR can be configured with YAML manifests or CLI.  
Let's install its CLI which avoids making mistakes when creating the YAML files:  
```bash
cd
curl -L -o tridentctl-protect https://github.com/NetApp/tridentctl-protect/releases/download/25.06.0/tridentctl-protect-linux-amd64
chmod +x tridentctl-protect
mv ./tridentctl-protect /usr/local/bin

curl -L -O https://github.com/NetApp/tridentctl-protect/releases/download/25.02.0/tridentctl-completion.bash
mkdir -p ~/.bash/completions
mv tridentctl-completion.bash ~/.bash/completions/
source ~/.bash/completions/tridentctl-completion.bash

cat <<EOT >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bash/completions/tridentctl-completion.bash
EOT
```

The CLI will appear as a new sub-menu in the _tridentctl_ tool.  
```bash
tridentctl-protect version
25.06.0
```
